Scoped Values is an incubator feature that allows better management of data that is scoped to specific contexts, particularly across multiple threads.

What it does:

Scoped Values simplify managing global or shared data in concurrent environments by limiting the scope of a variable to a specific context (e.g., a particular thread or a set of operations).
It provides a safer, more structured way to handle values that need to be passed across threads or tasks without using ThreadLocal variables.


Benefits:

Simplifies the use of thread-local data, which can be error-prone and hard to manage.
Improves thread safety and reduces bugs related to shared state in multi-threaded applications.
