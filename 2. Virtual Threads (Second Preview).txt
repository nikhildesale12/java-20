Virtual Threads are a significant new feature designed to improve the scalability of Java applications, especially those that need to handle a large number of concurrent tasks.

What it does:

Virtual Threads are lightweight threads that are managed by the JVM rather than by the operating system. Traditional Java threads are OS-managed, which means they have a relatively high overhead when creating and managing many concurrent threads. Virtual threads eliminate much of this overhead.
Java 20 introduces the second preview of Virtual Threads, building on the work started in Java 19.
With Virtual Threads, developers can now create and manage millions of concurrent tasks efficiently, which was previously challenging due to resource constraints.
This feature is part of the Project Loom initiative, which aims to simplify concurrency in Java by introducing lightweight, user-mode threads.

Example:

var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread!");
});


Benefits:

Virtual Threads allow for better scalability, especially for I/O-bound applications (such as web servers or microservices).
Developers can write applications that handle massive concurrency with far fewer resources compared to traditional threads.
Simplifies asynchronous programming as Virtual Threads allow tasks to be written in a sequential manner without callback hell.
