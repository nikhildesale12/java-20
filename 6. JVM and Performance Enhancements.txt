As with every new Java release, Java 20 includes numerous JVM improvements designed to optimize the performance and efficiency of applications:

What it does:

JVM optimizations typically focus on improving garbage collection (e.g., better management of memory and more efficient use of CPU resources).
Native memory tracking (NMT) improvements and JVM overhead optimizations help applications run more efficiently.
Performance improvements related to ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) and Shenandoah GC.


Benefits:

Improved throughput and lower latency for applications, especially those with high concurrency or large data sets.
Faster application startup times and better memory management.
